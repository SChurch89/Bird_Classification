# Bird_Classification - TensorFlow Image Processing Assignment

## **Overview**
This project is part of an assignment to gain hands-on experience with TensorFlow and image processing techniques. The primary objective is to run and analyze the **Deep Learning Bird Classifier** and the **TensorFlow/Keras image classification tutorial** from the official TensorFlow documentation.

## **Project Tasks**
### **Task 1: Deep Learning Bird Classifier**
- Ran a deep learning-based bird classifier model.
- Captured and shared the result screenshots.

### **Task 2: Image Classification using TensorFlow/Keras**
- Followed the tutorial: [TensorFlow Keras Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
- Implemented a basic image classification model using **TF and Keras**.
- Analyzed the results and documented insights.
